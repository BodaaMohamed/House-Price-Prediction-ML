# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🏡

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property characteristics. Using machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate price estimations to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training using ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Performance evaluation and insights

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-Learn & XGBoost for model building
- Jupyter Notebook for implementation

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:
[The Boston House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data)
